which offset a profit dip at warner bros  and less users for aol time warner said on friday that it now owns    of search engine google but its own internet business  aol  had has mixed fortunes it lost         subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters however  the company said aol s underlying profit before exceptional items rose    on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues it hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to timewarner internet customers and will try to sign up aol s existing customers for high speed broadband timewarner also has to restate      and      results following a probe by the us securities exchange commission  sec   which is close to concluding time warner s fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts  expectations but its film division saw profits slump     to     m  helped by box office flops alexander and catwoman  a sharp contrast to year earlier  when the third and final film in the lord of the rings trilogy boosted results for the full year  timewarner posted a profit of      bn  up     from its      performance  while revenues grew      to       bn  our financial performance was strong  meeting or exceeding all of our full year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility   chairman and chief executive richard parsons said for       timewarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around     and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins timewarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry

reported as advertising revenue it will now book the sale of its stake in aol europe as a loss on the value of that stake the dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the federal reserve head said the us trade deficit is set to stabilise and alan greenspan highlighted the us government s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it in late trading in new york  the dollar reached         against the euro  from         on thursday market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months on friday  federal reserve chairman mr greenspan s speech in london ahead of the meeting of g  finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse than expected us jobs data  i think the chairman s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he s taken for some time   said robert sinche  head of currency strategy at bank of america in new york  he s taking a longer term view  laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next  worries about the deficit concerns about china do  however  remain china s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the us currency s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made chinese export prices highly competitive but calls for a shift in beijing s policy have fallen on deaf ears  despite recent comments in a major chinese newspaper that the  time is ripe  for a loosening of the peg the g  meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in chinese policy in the meantime  the us federal reserve s decision on   february to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point   the sixth such move in as many months   has opened up a differential with european rates the half point window  some believe  could be enough to keep us assets looking more attractive  and could help prop up the dollar the recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits  as well as the us s yawning current account gap  both of which need to be funded by the buying of us bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments the white house will announce its budget on monday  and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars the owners of embattled russian oil giant yukos are to ask the buyer of its former production unit to pay back a     m      m  loan state owned rosneft bought the yugansk unit for     bn in a sale forced by russia to part settle a      bn tax claim against yukos yukos  owner menatep group says it will ask rosneft to repay a loan that yugansk had secured on its assets rosneft already faces a similar     m repayment demand from foreign banks legal experts said rosneft s purchase of yugansk would include such obligations  the pledged assets are with rosneft  so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of yugansk assets   said moscow based us lawyer jamie firestone  who is not connected to the case menatep group s managing director tim osborne told the reuters news agency   if they default  we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit  rosneft officials were unavailable for comment but the company has said it intends to take action against menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by yugansk yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm the sale went ahead in december and yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale british airways has blamed high fuel prices for a     drop in profits reporting its results for the three months to    december       the

m or       ba s profits were still better than market expectation of    m  and it expects a rise in full year revenues to help offset the increased price of aviation fuel  ba last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers in october  it increased this from    to     one way for all long haul flights  while the short haul surcharge was raised from       to    a leg yet aviation analyst mike powell of dresdner kleinwort wasserstein says ba s estimated annual surcharge revenues       m   will still be way short of its additional fuel costs   a predicted extra     m turnover for the quarter was up      to      bn  further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue looking ahead to its full year results to march       ba warned that yields   average revenues per passenger   were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low cost carriers however  it said sales would be better than previously forecast  for the year to march       the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a    to      improvement anticipated   ba chairman martin broughton said ba had previously forecast a    to    rise in full year revenue it also reported on friday that passenger numbers rose      in january aviation analyst nick van den brul of bnp paribas described ba s latest quarterly results as  pretty modest   it is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development  however  operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong   he said since the    september      attacks in the united states  ba has cut        jobs as part of a major cost cutting drive  our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products   mr eddington said  for example  we have taken delivery of six airbus a    aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our club world flat beds  ba s shares closed up four pence at       pence shares in uk drinks and food firm allied domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by france s pernod ricard reports in the wall street journal and the financial

pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics pernod s last major purchase was a third of us giant seagram in       the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms the other two thirds of seagram was bought by market leader diageo in terms of market value  pernod   at    bn euros      bn    is about    smaller than allied domecq  which has a capitalisation of     bn       bn     bn euros  last year pernod tried to buy glenmorangie  one of scotland s premier whisky firms  but lost out to luxury goods firm lvmh pernod is home to brands

snack food chains such as dunkin  donuts and baskin robbins ice cream the wsj said that the two were ripe for consolidation  having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the seagram purchase to just    bn euros  while allied has improved the performance of its fast food chains japan s economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to september  figures show revised figures indicated growth of just        and a similar sized contraction in the previous quarter on an annual basis  the data suggests annual growth of just       suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought a common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth the government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data  i maintain the view that japan s economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb  and we will monitor developments carefully   said economy minister heizo takenaka but in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead  observers were less sanguine  it s painting a picture of a recovery    much patchier than previously thought   said paul sheard  economist at lehman brothers in tokyo improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand  with private consumption up just      in the third quarter the us created fewer jobs than expected in january  but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years according to labor department figures  us firms added only         jobs in january the gain in non farm payrolls was below market expectations of         new jobs nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to       its lowest level since september      the job gains mean that president bush can celebrate   albeit by a very fine margin   a net growth in jobs in the us economy in his first term in office he presided over a net fall in jobs up to last november s presidential election   the first president to do so since herbert hoover as a result  job creation became a key issue in last year s election however  when adding december and january s figures  the administration s first term jobs record ended in positive territory the labor department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in december       from         to         analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions  it suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace   said rick egelton  deputy chief economist at bmo financial group  we are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment   the economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth   said ken mayland  president of clearview economics  that means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers  india  which attends the g  meeting of seven leading industrialised nations on friday  is unlikely to be cowed by its newcomer status in london on thursday ahead of the meeting  india s finance minister  lashed out at the restrictive trade policies of the g  nations he objected to subsidies on agriculture that make it hard for developing nations like india to compete he also called for reform of the united nations  the world bank and the imf palaniappan chidambaram  india s finance minister  argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order  given india and china s integration into the global economy he said the issue is not globalisation but  the terms of engagement in globalisation  mr chidambaram is attending the g  meeting as part of the g   group of nations  which account for two thirds of the world s population at a conference on developing enterprise hosted by uk finance minister gordon brown on friday  he said that he was in favour of floating exchange rates because they help countries cope with economic shocks  a flexible exchange rate is one more channel for absorbing both positive and negative shocks   he told the conference india  along with china  brazil  south africa and russia  has been invited to take part in the g  meeting taking place in london on friday and saturday china is expected to face renewed pressure to abandon its fixed exchange rate  which g  nations  in particular the us  have blamed for a surge in cheap chinese exports  some countries have tried to use fixed exchange rates i do not wish to make any judgements   mr chidambaram said separately  the imf warned on thursday that india s budget deficit was too large and would hamper the country s economic growth  which it forecast to be around      in the year to march      in the year to march       the indian

their flights because of overbooking  cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation new eu rules set compensation at between     euros        and     euros  depending on the length of the flight the new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights  including budget airlines airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost the european commission is facing two legal challenges   one from the european low fare airlines association  elaa  and the other from the international air transport association  iata   which has attacked the package as a  bad piece of legislation  previously  passengers could claim between     euros and     euros if they had been stopped from boarding however  only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations the eu decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights overbooking can often lead to  bumping    when a passenger is moved to a later flight when this happens against a passenger s will  airlines will now have to offer compensation in addition  if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline  all passengers must be paid compensation however  airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to  extraordinary circumstances  airlines fear that  extraordinary circumstances  may not include bad weather  security alerts or strikes   events which are outside of their control all eu based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the eu will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on thursday low cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels  arguing that the pay out could be worth more than the ticket  it s a preposterous piece of legislation  we among all airlines are fighting this   ryanair deputy chief executive michael cawley told radio   s today programme the european regions airline association  eraa  claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes andy clarke  eraa director of air transport  said that the ec advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather ec spokeswoman marja quillinan meiland conceded there were  grey areas  but said  these are not as big as the airlines are making out  in cases of dispute  national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case  she said new technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather  she added the eraa s mr clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules  the extra costs would be passed onto passengers  we reckon it s going to cost european air passengers   not the airlines  the airlines have no money  it has to be paid by passengers      bn euros  that s over   bn a year loaded onto european passengers   mr clarke said  that s basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted  on wednesday  jacques barrot  vice president of the european commission and also commissioner for transport  said that the changes were necessary  the boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers  right   this is a concrete example of how the union benefits people s daily

group and the tata group customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up  a survey suggests once past the welcome message  callers on average hang up after just    seconds of listening to canned music the drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of     every year  customers are getting used to the idea of an  always available  society   says cara diemont of it firm dimension data  which commissioned the survey however  call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls  she says  from just over    in      to a record       during last year when automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation  where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages  the number of abandoned calls is even higher   a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait one possible reason for the lack in patience  ms diemont says  is the fact that more customers are calling  on the move  using their mobile phones the surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres  growing range of tasks  once a call centre may have looked after mortgages  now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards  insurance and current accounts   ms diemont says problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand in hand with more training  the survey found in what dimension data calls an  alarming development   the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from    to just    days  leaving  agents not equipped to deal with customers  this  ms diemont warns  is  scary  and not good for the bottom line either poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers as a result  call centres have a high  churn rate   with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year  which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff resolution rates   the number of calls where a customer s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction   are running at just     when the query is passed on to a second or third person   a specialist or manager   rates rise to about      but that is still well below the industry target of an     resolution rate suggestions that  outsourcing    relocating call centres to low cost countries like india or south africa   is to blame are wrong  ms diemont says there are  no big differences in wait time and call resolution  between call centres based in europe or north america and those in developing countries around the world  you can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place   she says however  companies that decide to  offshore  their operations are driven not just by cost considerations only     of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money but not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution nearly two thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres they give three key reasons for not making the move     call centre operations are part of their business  core function       they are worried about the risk of going abroad      they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive the survey was conducted by sunovate on behalf of dimension data  and is based on in depth questionnaires of     call centres in    countries and five continents what are your experiences with call centres are you happy to listen to vivaldi or greensleeves  or do you want an immediate response and if you work in a call centre  did your training prepare you for your job leisure group rank could unveil plans to demerge its film services unit and sell its media business  reports claim rank  formerly famous for the carry on series

less successful last year it made profits of      m on a turnover of       m and experts suggest its success in moving to dvds from vhs video could make it an attractive target for a private equity

     in november to       million people  or       of the workforce the seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected  as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect but officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market  there are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand   said frank juergen weise  head of the federal labour agency  in a statement  but growth of         in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market  high oil prices and the soaring euro   which damages the competitiveness of exporters   were also having a negative effect  he said the brunt of the unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of germany  where the rate is       with unemployment stuck above   million for years  the government of chancellor gerhard schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda a controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work  paid for by cutting some cherished benefits  has sparked anger among some german workers strikes in a number of industries  notably among the country s iconic carmakers  have demonstrated the displeasure   as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold among the new initiatives are the so called  one euro jobs  which top up unemployment benefit the scheme s formal launch is january  but hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting the unemployment statistics  economists said  the deterioration of the labour market does not come as a surprise   said isabelle kronawitter at hypovereinsbank  job creation measures probably prevented a stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers  the french economy picked up speed at the end of       official figures show   but still looks set to have fallen short of the government s hopes according to state statistics body insee  growth for the three months to december was a seasonally adjusted           ahead of the      forecast if confirmed  that would be the best quarterly showing since early      it leaves gdp up      for the full year  but short of the      which the french government had predicted despite the apparent shortfall in annual economic growth  the good quarterly figures   a so called  flash estimate    mark a continuing trend of improving indicators for the health of the french

  bn the deficit with china  up       at     bn  was the largest ever recorded with a single country however  on a monthly basis the us trade gap narrowed by      in december to      bn the us consumer s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars  and even wine and cheese  reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of president bush s economic policies democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices for example  they believe china s currency policy   which us manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as       has given china s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against us competitors meanwhile  the bush administration argues that the us deficit reflects the fact the america is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world  spurring on more demand for imported goods some economists say this may allow an upward revision of us economic growth in the fourth quarter but others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar denominated assets  which may in turn harm growth for all of       us exports rose       to       trillion  but imports rose even faster by       to a new record of       trillion foreign oil exports surged by       to a record       bn  reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand imports were not affected by the dollar s weakness last year  we expect the deficit to continue to widen in      even if the dollar gets

protection in houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its yugansk division by the russian authorities the court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of yugansk  which yukos claims was illegally sold separately  former yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky began testimony on friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion mr khodorkovsky   who has been in jail for more than a year   pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities  i pride myself on heading for    years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees   he told a russian court yugansk was auctioned to help pay off      bn       bn  in unpaid taxes it was bought for     bn by a previously unknown group  which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state controlled oil company rosneft texas judge letitia clark said yukos did not have enough of a us presence to establish us jurisdiction  the vast majority of the business and financial activities of yukos continue to occur in russia   judge clark said in her ruling  such activities require the continued participation of the russian government  yukos had argued that a us court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its yugansk unit was sold  since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer bruce misamore lives in houston yukos claimed it sought help in the us because other forums   russian courts and the european court of human rights   were either unfriendly or offered less protection russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the us courts in her ruling  the judge acknowledged that  it appears likely that agencies of the russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under united states law  but she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction the us court s jurisdiction had been challenged by deutsche bank and gazpromneft  a former unit of russian gas monopoly gazprom which is due to merge with rosneft analysts said the ability of gazprom and rosneft to trade freely overseas had been stifled while the ownership of yugansk remained unclear yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling however  it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues  we believe the merits of our case are

vehicles in the us on safety grounds  according to federal regulators the national highway traffic safety administration  nhtsa  said the largest recall involves         pickups  vans and sports utility vehicles  suvs  this is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems the affected vehicles in the product recall are from the      and      model years  gm said those vehicles with potential faults are the chevrolet avalanche  express  kodiak  silverade and suburban  the gmc savana  sierra and yukon the nhtsa said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open this could allow hydraulic fluid to leak  which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash  it warned gm is also recalling        cadillac xlr coupes  srx suvs and pontiac grand prix sedans from the      model year this is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures  requiring more braking in addition  the car giant is calling back        buick raniers  chevrolet trailblazers  gmc envoys and isuzu ascenders from the      model years because the

company as part of president chavez s agrarian reform programme officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers the government is cracking down on so called latifundios  or large rural estates  which it says are lying idle the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure the firm  whose agroflora subsidiary operates    farms in venezuela  insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted hato el charcote  a beef cattle ranch owned by agroflora according to reuters  they plan to seize        acres        hectares  from the        acre         hectare  farm officials claim that agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question they also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production  the legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus   state prosecutor alexis ortiz told reuters  as a consequence the government has taken action  controversial reforms passed in      give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the   th century critics say the powers   which president chavez argues are needed to help the country s poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy   trample all over private property rights the vestey group said it had owned the land since      and would co operate fully with the authorities but a spokesman added   agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land  the company pointed out that the farm  which employs     workers  provides meat solely for the venezuelan market last month  the government said it had identified more than     idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further

connections to many of the country s leading politicians he used his wealth and influence to bring the winter olympic games to nagano in      but last year  he was forced to resign from all the posts

this amount seibu railways has been delisted from the stock exchange  its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid mr tsutsumi s fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in japanese companies his determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood the illegitimate third son of a rich father  who made his money buying up property as japan rebuilt after world war ii  he has described the demands his father made  i felt enormous pressure when i dined with him and it was nothing but pain   tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in       he scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned that allowing huge us budget deficits to continue could have  severe  consequences speaking to the house budget committee he urged congress to take action to cut the deficit  such as increasing taxes while the us economy is growing at a  reasonably good pace  he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the us pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy  he said the government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby boom generation retires  i fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver if existing promises need to be changed  those changes should be made sooner rather than later   mr greenspan said he also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity  retirement and health programmes would need  significant  changes he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees  as the promised benefits for the soon to retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending  he added he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red despite the dire warnings  mr greenspan did offer some good news for the short term as us growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely  which should cut some costs since president george w bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of     bn last year shares in uk coal have

of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry  our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away   said norbert reithofer  a member of the bmw management board initially  bmw said it would produce         mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford  but the target was quickly reached  then raised  time and time again not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue  the risk is that after they ve invested massively in the brand  demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle   said brad wernle  from automotive news

stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for     five years ago to the phoenix consortium in       when bmw still owned rover  the oxford factory was producing the award winning rover    during that year        people produced        cars last year  in the same factory  almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just       mini workers the mini factory s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge  which in      produced         rover cars last year  mg rover  which employs more than       people  produced just         cars  though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation  saic  that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge indeed  mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does  it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers  which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford  are taken into account a combination of

club the ons is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on friday  the mpc judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate   ms lomax said the bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information rachel lomax cited the late     s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published  but substantially revised upwards years later  the statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past   she said improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the monetary policy committee  mpc  makes the right decisions  she said the bank of england is working in tandem with the ons to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data her remarks follow criticism from the house of lords economic affairs committee  which said the mpc had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the    target a slowdown in the housing market and this year s surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky  leading to a more uncertain outlook  this year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the     s and     s   ms lomax said  the mpc will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past    years  decisions on interest rates are made after the mpc gathers together the range of indicators available every month the clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction  ms lomax intimated  in economic assessment  there is safety in numbers  electrolux saw its shares rise     on tuesday after

argued that mr ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at worldcom  ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet wall street earnings estimates but ms cooper  who now runs her own consulting business  told a jury in new york on wednesday that external auditors arthur andersen had approved worldcom s accounting in early      and      she said andersen had given a

germany s air traffic controllers  organisation or the airport authority but wanted instead to see if it was possible to sue the german federal agencies that gave the orders the company said that it had to cancel    short and medium distance flights  affecting about       passengers long haul travellers were not disrupted central to the problem was that instead of half an hour  the arrival of president bush on the german leg of his european tour took the best part of an hour  lufthansa said during that time  restrictions were put on planes taxiing  taking off and landing at frankfurt s rhein main airport the extra time taken by president bush and his entourage meant that there was a knock on effect that led to significant delays mr lamberty said that    outgoing flights and

that the ifo index has taken such a knock   said dz bank economist bernd weidensteiner  the main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak  particularly in the retail trade  economy

he expected  a modest economic upswing  to continue germany s economy grew      last year after shrinking in      however  the economy contracted by      during the last three months of       mainly

billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity the most endangered are those who live in the least developed countries the fao report said that support for farmers in

negotiations to liberalise trade  easing developing countries  access to the world market it also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations it recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation according to the organisation  subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade

direct investment in its construction sector kamal nath  commerce and industry minister  announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting analysts say improving india s infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too the indian government s decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector  according to some indian firms a spokesman for dlf builders  dr vancheshwar  told the bbc this will mean  better offerings  for consumers as well as builders he said the firm will benefit from world class  strategic partnerships  design expertise and technology  while consumers will have better choice  the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to      will be allowed on the  automatic route  in the construction sector  on projects including housing  hotels  resorts  hospitals and educational establishments the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board  which can be bureaucratic the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers  and benefit steel and brick making industries mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired  foreign investors can enter any construction development area  be it to build resorts  townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least        square meters          square feet  within a specific timeframe   said mr nath  without specifying the timeframe previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area  discouraging some from entering the indian market this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively  without developing it anshuman magazine  managing director  of cb richard ellis   an international real estate company   told the bbc this was  a big positive step  however  chittabrata majumdar  general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions  citu   said allowing fdi in the country is compromising india s own  self reliance  he said   no country can develop on

the        lr has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders he also said that while the plane may be able to fly to sydney from london in one hit  prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey for airbus  the future is big   it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as     people between large hub airports from there  passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft

german consumers have kept their money to themselves major companies including volkswagen  daimlerchrysler and siemens have spent much of      in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs according to the statistics office  destatis  rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand but the relentless rise in the value of the euro last

its investment there slashed by mps iran s parliament voted by a large majority to cut turkcell s stake in a new mobile network from     to     the move  which was justified on national security grounds  follows an earlier vote by mps to give themselves a veto over foreign investments turkcell said the decision  increases the risks  attached to the project although the company s statement said it would continue to monitor developments  observers said they thought turkcell was set to pull out of the   bn deal  the possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero   said atinc ozkan  analyst at finans investment in istanbul if turkcell does back out  mtn   the south african firm which lost out in the original tender   may well be back in the running the company has said it

chosen to build and run tehran s new imam khomeini international airport   but the army closed it just hours after it opened in may      in both cases  the justification has been national security  amid allegations that the turkish firms are too close to israel the hardline posture taken by parliament  which is dominated by religious conservatives  could yet impact other inward investments european union finance ministers are meeting on thursday in brussels  where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax a levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the world s poorest nations airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans  saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure the eu said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines it was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the  competitiveness of the airlines  ministers will also be discussing reforms to regulations governing european public spending global leaders have focused attention on poverty reduction and development at recent meetings of the g  group and world economic forum the world s richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to      of their annual gross national income by      many eu ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel   tabled by france and germany following the recent g  meeting at present  the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in eu member states despite a short lived increase in palestinian jobs in       the economy is performing well below its potential  said a world bank report unemployment stood at      compared with     before the uprising against israeli occupation four years ago young people are particularly hard hit with     out of work  compared with     four years ago but         new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures however  during the first half of this year  the palestinian economy lost more than        jobs last year s growth rate of    can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence  the report said according to the report  intifada  closures and palestinian economic crisis  an assessment  there is a close link between the number of closures   both border closures and internal closures between cities   and palestinian economic problems the closures arranged by israel restrict the movement of palestinian people and goods  slowing down trade  closures are a key factor behind today s economic crisis in the west bank   said nigel roberts  world bank country director for the west bank and gaza nearly half of all palestinians   some       live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks the report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of     m a year from international donors  some of which goes towards job creation it also called on the palestinian authority to revive its reform programme and maintain financial discipline to create an investment friendly climate this week colin powell  us secretary of state was visiting the west bank to stress us support for a smooth palestinian election in january china lent russia   bn      bn  to help the russian government renationalise the key yuganskneftegas unit of oil group yukos  it has been revealed the kremlin said on tuesday that the   bn which russian state bank veb lent state owned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long term oil supply deal with china the deal sees rosneft receive   bn in credits from china s cnpc according to russian newspaper vedomosti  these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk reports said cnpc had been offered     of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long term oil supply deal instead analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos  yugansk s former owner  if cnpc had become a shareholder rosneft and veb declined to comment  the two companies  rosneft and cnpc  have agreed on the pre payment for long term deliveries   said russian oil official sergei oganesyan  there is nothing unusual that the pre payment is for five to six years  the announcements help to explain how rosneft  a medium sized  indebted  and relatively unknown firm  was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk yugansk was sold for     bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a    bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky once the country s richest man  mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of china s desire to secure long term oil supplies to feed its booming economy china s thirst for products such as crude oil  copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels  clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage  in russia    said dmitry lukashov  an analyst at brokerage aton  they understand property rights in russia are not the most important rights  and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies   if the price of oil is fixed under the deal  which is unlikely  it could be very profitable for the chinese   mr lukashov continued  and rosneft is in desperate need of cash  so it s a good deal for them too  fiat and general motors  gm

yugansk  was sold to pay off a      bn       bn  back tax bill yukos argued that since it had a us subsidiary and local bank accounts  the us court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of yugansk but deutsche bank   itself a target of a yukos lawsuit   said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case deutsche bank s evidence came on the first day of a two day hearing in houston its lawyer  hugh ray  told the court that yukos had claimed it had transferred    m into two texas bank accounts opened by its new us subsidiary by doing so  he said  the firm had intended to reinforce its us presence   and thus its chances of getting its case heard in us courts but he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after yukos made its bankruptcy application on    december  and then backdated yukos chief financial officer bruce misamore  who had moved to the us in early december to set up yukos usa  acknowledged the point he said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork  but that money had indeed been transferred on    december even so  he told the court that only          had been in the accounts that day  with the rest

the property market is continuing to cool down changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in november  thus flattering the december figures  analysts said in october last

rising oil and metals prices had kept costs high the survey added that rising input prices and cooling demand had deterred factory managers from hiring new workers in an effort to cut costs that

 comments  said junya tanase of jpmorgan chase bank in tokyo  were  generally too weak to produce a market reaction  still  by the standards of diplomacy the european ministers were forthright nicolas sarkozy of france said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit europe s economies by eating into their exports  we are concerned about these developments  which are destabilising  and which are linked to the accumulation of deficits by our american friends   he said the comments come a day after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was  in america s interest  but that was not enough for mr sarkozy  if the americans were to change their policy  it s up to them to say so   he said and the european union s monetary affairs commissioner  made it clear that action was necessary  i fully welcome the words of mr snow   said joaquin almunia   but we will need to see decisions adopted in that direction  if the imbalances in the us economy are not adjusted in the future  the decision in the market will be as in the past weeks  economists point out that whatever europe says  in the short term a weaker dollar

declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of new world wines wine makers  however  claimed the support did not go far enough the package was announced by agriculture minister dominique bussereau after talks with vintners  representatives the bulk of the money   about   m euros   will be offered in the form of preferential loans to heavily indebted producers to enable them to reschedule their payments a further   m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives  which make up the majority of french producers  in low interest loans efforts to promote french wine abroad

consent  while     vintners will be helped to take early retirement the government will also seek european union approval to distil about     million litres of excess wine into alcohol  with vintners receiving compensation production is currently outstripping demand by about     the support is designed to make french producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across

russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales  s p said the government s own debt is looking a good bet  these improvements are so significant that they now outweight the

built its reputation on producing generic versions of big name pharmaceutical products but competition has intensified and the firm and the company is short on new product launches the most recent was the annoucement in december      that it had won exclusive marketing rights for a generic version of the famous anti depressant prozac from its maker  eli lilly it also lost a key court case in march       banning it from selling a version of pfizer s popular hypertension drug norvasc in the us research and development of new drugs is continuing apace  with r d spending rising     to    m rupees   a key cause of the decrease in profits alongside the fall in sales patents on a number of well known products are due to run out in the near future  representing an opportunity for dr reddy  whose shares are listed in new york  and other indian generics manufacturers sales in dr reddy s generics business fell      to    m rupees another staple of the the firm s business  the sale of ingredients

competitors are gathering strength although they too face heavy competitive pressures british energy firm burren energy has been awarded two potentially lucrative oil exploration contracts in egypt the company successfully bid for the two contracts  granted by government owned oil firms  covering onshore and offshore areas in the gulf of suez burren energy already has a presence in egypt  having been awarded an exploration contract last year the firm  which floated in       recently announced a deal to buy     of indian firm hindustan oil exploration the      m deal gives burren energy access to the indian oil and gas industry this latest contract expands burren energy s global exploration and production portfolio   it also holds contracts in turkmenistan and the republic of congo  these assets significantly increase our exploration portfolio in egypt and we continue to investigate further opportunities in this region   said chief executive finian o sullivan the us dollar s slide against the euro and yen has halted after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was  in america s interest  but analysts said any gains are likely to be short lived as problems with the us economy were still significant they also pointed out that positive comments apart  president george w bush s administration had done little to stop the dollar s slide a weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit the dollar was trading at         against the euro at     gmt  still close to the         record level set on    november against the japanese yen  it was trading at        yen  after hitting a seven month low of        earlier in the day policy makers in europe have called the dollar s slide  brutal  and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth however  it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro s rise at a monthly meeting of eurozone ministers late on monday higher growth in europe is regarded by us officials as a way the huge us current account deficit   that has been weighing on the dollar   could be reduced mr snow who is currently in dublin at the start of a four nation eu visit  has applauded ireland s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth  the eurozone is growing below its potential when a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences    for the citizens of those economies    and for their trading partners   he said mr snow s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on monday  but he was careful to qualify his statement  our basic policy  of course  is to let open  competitive markets set the values   he explained  markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals  us officials have also said that other economies need to grow  so the us is not the main global growth engine economists say that the fundamentals  or key indicators  of the us economy are looking far from rosy domestic consumer demand is cooling  and heavy spending by president bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record     bn      bn  the current account deficit  meanwhile  hit a record     bn in the second quarter of      for many analysts  a weaker dollar is here to stay  no end is in sight   said carsten fritsch  a strategist at commerzbank   it is only a matter of time until the euro reaches        some analysts maintain the us is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in europe  thus boosting its economy the international monetary fund is to cut its      growth forecast for the german economy from      to       the financial times deutschland reported the imf will also reduce its growth estimate for the    member eurozone economy from      to       the newspaper reported the german economy has been faltering  with unemployment levels rising to a seventy year high of     million its sluggish performance continues to hamper the entire eurozone the imf s draft world economic outlook   due to be published in april   would point to a marked deterioration in germany s economy  the ft report said in september  the imf had said that german growth for the current year would be      the imf has also revised eurozone forecasts  the paper said  taking into account high oil prices  the strength of the euro and weak demand in many of the world s leading economies europe s economic difficulties have been highlighted by the organisation for economic co operation and development  which argued in a report published on tuesday that the continent could only achieve us living standards by freeing up its labour markets  the eurozone does not look like it has a self sustaining recovery   james carrick  an economist with abn amro  told the newspaper  it is too dependant on the rest of the world  us car firms general motors  gm  and ford have been forced to cut production in the face of falling car sales us sales at gm sank       in february compared to a year ago while ford sales dropped    as foreign rivals took a bigger share of the market meanwhile  asian carmakers fared well   toyota sales jumped     while rival nissan notched up a     increase overall sales across the industry also fell to      million vehicles from      million a year earlier gm and ford blamed high fuel prices for low sales of big trucks and gas guzzling sports utility vehicles  suvs    the vehicles that provide the biggest profits gm added that us truck sales fell    in february while car business tumbled      however it did acknowledge that some new products   such as the pontiac g  and chevrolet cobalt   had put in solid performances  the calendar year is starting off slower than expected  both for gm and the industry   said mark laneve  gm s vice president for north american sales  service and marketing the slump in sales prompted the group to cut production in north america by      it has already reduced output by around    in the face of growing stockpiles meanwhile  ford which posted its ninth consecutive drop in monthly us sales  said it was cutting first quarter north american production by another        vehicles  or      chrysler  the us unit of germany s daimlerchrysler  was the only detroit based automaker to boast an increase in market share during the month   with sales rising    but america s loss was its foreign rivals  gain as they continued to nibble away at the us market while japan s top car maker toyota and nissan saw sales accelerate  even the smaller suzuki motor corp snapped up a more business with sales improving       on a year ago in       the firm launched an ambitious plan to triple us sales by      as it seeks to become a bigger player in the asian assault on the us market korea s hyundai was another big gainer  turning in a     surge in february sales toyota put its rise in sales down to strong results for its redesigned avalon sedan and a      surge in sales of its gas electric prius hybrid mid size sedan as petrol price conscious consumers looked to vehicles that were cheaper to run  as gas prices continue their upward march  fuel efficiency catches the public eye   jim press  vice president and chief operating officer of toyota s us sales arm  said in a statement former worldcom chief bernie ebbers has denied claims that he knew accountants were doctoring the books at the firm speaking in court  mr ebbers rejected allegations he pressured ex chief financial officer scott sullivan to falsify company financial statements mr sullivan  made accounting decisions   he told the federal court  saying his finance chief had  a keen command of the numbers  mr ebbers has denied charges of fraud and conspiracy during his second day of questioning in the new york trial mr ebbers played down his working relationship with mr sullivan and denied he frequently met him to discuss company business when questioned by the prosecution  in a lot of weeks  we would speak     three or four times   mr ebbers said  adding that conversations about finances were rarely one on one and were usually discussed by a  group of people  instead mr ebbers relationship to mr sullivan is key to the case surrounding financial corruption that led to the collapse of the firm in      following the discovery of an    bn accounting fraud the prosecution s star witness is mr sullivan  one of six worldcom executives indicted in the case  he has pleaded guilty to fraud and appeared as a prosecution witness as part of an agreement with prosecutors during his time on the witness stand mr sullivan repeatedly told jurors he met frequently with mr ebbers  told him about changes made to worldcom s accounts to hide costs and had warned him such practises were improper however during the case on tuesday mr ebbers denied the allegations  i wasn t advised by scott sullivan of anything ever being wrong   he told the court  he s never told me he made an entry that wasn t right if he had  we wouldn t be here today  mr ebbers could face a jail sentence of up to    years if convicted of all the charges he is facing shareholders lost about     bn in worldcom s collapse         workers lost their jobs and the company went bankrupt the company emerged from bankruptcy last year and is now known as mci '"
